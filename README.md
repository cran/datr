`datr` allows R users to interact with the [Dat](https://datproject.org) network. You can load, store, or share data on the Dat network, without including any intermediaries that can snoop on your content. All transfers are end-to-end encrypted.

## Example

![GIF of demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libscie/datr/master/assets/demo.gif)

or in plain text

```R
datr::dat_install(os = 'linux')

datr::clone_dat('dat://0286381d95864386a83aadb136a60c1d09d079c5a4ff0e403fa126644ba4c6ab',
 dir = '~/test-datr/')

dir.create('~/test-datr-sharing')
setwd('~/test-datr-sharing')

datr::create_dat()

write.csv(data.frame(x = rnorm(100, 0, 1), y = rnorm(100, 50, 23)),
 '~/test-datr-sharing/test-data.csv',
 row.names = FALSE)

datr::sync_dat()
```



## Installation

You can install `datr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("libscie/datr")
```

See below for [Windows](#windows), [Mac](#mac), and [Linux](#linux) specific instructions for installing Dat. `v0.1.0` will be submitted to CRAN (almost done üèÅ)!

### Windows

Fire up `R` *with* Administrator privileges by right clicking the icon and selecting "Run as administrator"

[![Run as administrator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libscie/datr/master/assets/run-as-admin.png)](https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-run-an-app-as-administrator-in-windows-10/)

Once the program launches, run `datr::dat_install()`. The package then initiates downloading Dat and installs it on your local machine. 

Upon completion, reboot R and you can start using the package üòª (adminstrator privileges no longer needed)

### Mac

```R
devtools::install_github('libscie/datr', ref = 'install')
datr::dat_install(os = 'macos')
```

Note that there currently is an issue out that could benefit from feedback on installation on Mac (#7).

### Linux

Run `datr::dat_install(os = 'linux')` from your R console. There's no need to specify which flavor of Linux you're running, but you might to need to restart your R session üôã
